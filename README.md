# Importing-Data-from-Wikipedia

The purpose of this project is to create a DataFrame showing a list of Asian Countries. I got the data from Wikipedia website (source = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Asian_countries_by_area'). In this project, I used <b>requests</b> and <b>BeautifulSoup</b> to do web scraping.
